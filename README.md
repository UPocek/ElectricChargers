# IOS & Android application for EV charging stations network

The result of this project is a cross-platform prototype mobile application for an EV charging network. 

## Development process

### Stage 1 - Client meeting

The client for this project was Branko Milosavljevic and after meeting with him we created a project specification that is located in the "Specifikacija" folder of this repo.

### Stage 2 - Diagrams

In the initial stages of communication with our client, we created a UML use case diagram to make sure that we all are on the same page about different aspects of the project and different user types and their role. Later based on this diagram we created a class diagram, a state machine diagram, and also a few activities as well as sequence diagrams for core app functionality to make it easier for future implementation.

### Stage 3 - Prototipe

After the diagrams were approved we started working on a prototype of the mobile app. As a framework for this part, we choose [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. Experience with flutter was awesome and after a few intense coding sessions, we had a working prototype fully equipt with custom Google Maps API integration, NFC triggers, and backend code in C# that uses SQL database hosted on Azure for data persistence.

### Stage 4 - Result presentation

For presentation day we created an NFC equipt station model built from cardboard and published our app to the IOS App Store and also TestFlight. By doing this we were able to install the application on the client's iPhone and give him a full feel of how the will app work in the real world.

## Final result
