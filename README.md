# IOS & Android application for EV charging stations network

Result of this project is cross platform prototipe mobile application for EV charging network. 

## Development process

### Stage 1 - Client meeting

The client for this project was Branko Milosavljevic and after meeting with him we created project specification that is located in "Specifikacija" folder of this repo.

### Stage 2 - Diagrams

In initial stages of comunication with our client we created UML use case diagram to make sure that we all are on the same page about different aspects of the project and different user types and their role. Later based on this diagram we creted class diagram, state machine diagram and also a few activity as well as sequence diagrams for core app functionality to make it easier for future implementation.

### Stage 3 - Prototipe

After diagrams were approved we stared working on a prototipe of the mobile app. As a framework for this part we choose [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. Experience with flutter was awesome and after a few intense coding sessions we had a working prototipe fully equipt with custom googe map api integration, NFC triggers and backend coded in C# that uses SQL database hosted on Azure for data persistance.

### Stage 4 - Final result presentation

For presentation day we created NFC equipt station model build from cardboard and published our app to the IOS App Store and also TestFlight. By doing this we were able to install application on clients personal Iphone and to give him full fell of how will app work in the real world.
